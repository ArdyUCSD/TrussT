		<h3>Primary point of contact with the Client (Port Authority) and conducts overall project management including oversight of a detailed Gantt chart. Financial responsibilities include overall accounting for the project, purchasing materials, and budgeting. The CEO/CFO is the only representative from the team that can address legal matters with the Port Authority, in addition to attending weekly meetings with a representative from the Port Authority to receive updates on critical information and go over all budgetary matters. They are also the primary representatives that will sign their corporation up for all testing and competition. This person should have good people skills, be organized and professional, and someone who can motivate and encourage the team to perform. Responsible for tracking team member time sheets.</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>Julio Martinez<br>Technical Writer</h4>
		<h3>Primarily responsible for all documentation and reports submitted on behalf of the corporation such as the Schematic Design PowerPoint (week 2), the Design Development Analysis Report (week 3), the Mechanical Systems Design Report (week 4), the Design Development Analysis Validation Report (week 5), the FEA of Joints and Connections Report (week 7), the Pre-test Report (week 10), and the Final Report (Finals week). This person should be a strong technical writer, be organized and be able to consolidate various sections provided by other team members into a cohesive document.</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>Michael Labib<br>Structural Designer</h4>
		<h3>Responsible for the overall Schematic Design concept (week 2), refinement of the design for the Design Development Report (week 3), and the Final design (week 4). This includes working with the Structural Analyst to identify the most critical joint(s) in the crane, and conduct a detailed connection design and checks for this critical member using SolidWorks FEA analysis and hand calculations (week 7). The Structural Designer should work with the SolidWorks and AutoCAD Designers (described below) to produce design details for the report (Finals week).</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>MohammadReza Rashidian<br>Structural Analyst</h4>
		<h3>Preliminary analysis for the Schematic Design presentation (week 2), which includes the preliminary design concept and identifies critical connections or members and an understanding of the load path. This analysis is further refined for the Design Development Analysis Report (week 3), which beyond load path and critical members must include results from a variety of load cases. Supporting hand calculations that verify/validate the analytical model must be provided in the Design Development Analysis Validation Report (Hand Calculations) (week 5) to help identify assumptions in the model that could be incorrect such as connection details, boundary conditions, applications of loads, and material properties. Fully refined analyses and predictions for the test phases including fatigue analysis will be required (week 10). This person should be proficient in SAP2000 and finite element analysis strategies as well as technically sound in structural analysis theory (for hand calculations).</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>Alfred Moussa<br>Mechanical Designer</h4>
		<h3>One engineer dedicated to develop the mechanical systems for the crane and submit the Mechanical Systems Report with a schematic of mechanical design (location of motors and/or sensors), screenshot of the RoboPro program, and description of the logic for the RoboPro controlling the crane (week 4). This person must have a good mechanical sense, understand RoboPro and work closely with the Control Engineer, and have good statics and dynamics skills to be able to predict and demonstrate through hand calculations forces in the pulley systems and the pendulum motion of the structure during dynamic loading. This person must also be able to utilize SolidWorks to visualize and design a working mechanical system. Also work closely with the SolidWorks Designer on the final construction documents to detail the final mechanical design.</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>Sasan Zenhari<br>Control Engineer</h4>
		<h3>Responsible for controlling the mechanical systems and developing the required RoboPro programs to operate the crane during testing and competition. Development and submission of Initial RoboPro Design (week 5). Responsible for orchestrating all required testing (weeks 5−9) to fine tune the control program and meet the specifications and goals for the project. Coordinates the competition (week 10). Responsible for providing schematics of the RoboPro programs to the Technical Writer for the Final Report and Presentation. In addition to being proficient in RoboPro, the control engineer must be a very calm, patient person who can solve problems on the fly. The control engineer should be able to delegate tasks to teammates in a constructive manner in the heat of the moment.</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>Hsuan-Ching Sang<br>Construction Engineer</h4>
		<h3>The Construction Engineer is responsible for the entire fabrication of the crane. Work with the CEO/CFO to identify materials necessary for purchasing (week 3 and as needed). Responsible for coordinating fabrication (throughout weeks 4−8) and asking the CEO/CFO to schedule other members of the corporation to assist with fabrication as the Gantt chart allows. The Control Engineer must document when as−built changes deviate from the original design details due to construction challenges or material limitations, communicate this to the SolidWorks and AutoCAD Design Engineers (see below) to ensure final SolidWorks/AutoCAD models are accurate, and provide information to the Technical Writer for the Final Report. This person needs to be very good at hands on construction, have patience to produce high quality products, and work well delegating tasks to all members of the corporation in conjunction with the CEO/CFO.</h3><hr>
		<img src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robot.jpg" id="teamphoto"><h4>Ana Kuznecova<br>SolidWorks Design Engineer</h4>
		<h3>Communicates with structural designer and mechanical designer to ensure final design can accommodate structural loads and mechanical systems. Develop a preliminary Solidworks model for the Schematic Design Proposal Presentation (week 2). Develop a more refined Solidworks model for the Design Development Analysis Report (week 3), develop the Preliminary SolidWorks Motion Simulation (week 6), and work with the Structural Analyst to use the model to assess dynamic response of the mechanical systems. Finalize Motion Simulation and all drawings/marketing materials for final predictions in the Pre−Test report (week 10) and for the Final Report and Presentation (finals week). Work with the Structural Designer, Mechanical Designer, and Construction Engineer to finalize the Final Construction Documents using SolidWorks for the submittal (week 8).</h3><hr>

		<h3>Communicates with structural designer and mechanical designer to ensure final design can accommodate structural loads and mechanical systems. Preliminary AutoCAD drawings for the Schematic Design Proposal Presentation (week 2), refined AutoCAD drawings for the Design Development Analysis Report (week 3). Work with Structural Designer to produce detailed design drawings for the critical connection (week 7). Finalize all AutoCAD detailed design drawings for the Final Report and Presentation (finals week). Responsible for Integrated Design section of final report that discusses how all components and disciplines work together and require synergy for project to come together (details will be provided in Final Report guidelines).</h3><hr>
